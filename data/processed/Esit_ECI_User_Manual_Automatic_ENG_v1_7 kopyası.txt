ECI is a smart signal converter and control device which is designed for weigh measuring systems. It is a fast,
sensitive device with a high accuracy class. It is designed suitably for using at industrial applications and standard weigh
measuring areas. It is used as weigh, force and pressure measuring areas. Many optional modules can be
added/modified easily thanks to the modular smart “plug and play” expansion structure.
This operating manual contains exemplary wording related to the installation, operation and field operation of
the ECI.

ECI Multi Functional Weighing Indicator User Manual (Automatic) Sayfa 101 ScaleType
Determines the operation of the weighing device. In weighing devices;
“e”: is referred as the scale interval It is the difference between two subsequent indications.
There may be a signle "e" division as well as more than one partitions. The options related to this
parameter are;
1) Single
2) Multi Int
3) Multi Rng

ECI Multi Functional Weighing Indicator User Manual (Automatic) Sayfa 102 Single: The weighing device with a single scale interval and
capacity.
Multi Int: In this operation there are 3 different scale intervals
and capacities. There is a different scale interval in each
capacity range;
Weight < LowerZoneLimit + 9e1  e1 (the first zone scale
interval)
LowerZoneLimit + 9e1 < Weight < UpperZoneLimit + 9e2 e2 =
2*e1 (the second zone scale interval)
UpperZoneLimit + 9e1 < Weight < Capacity + 9e3  e3 = 2*e2
(the third zone scale interval)
"e1" scale interval is determined with Resolution parameter. e2
and e3 are determined automatically. If the respective zone capacity +9e is observed when the weight is increased, it is proceeded to the next scale interval. When the
weight is decreasing, it is decreased to the previous scale interval when it is shifted from the upmost zone to
the lowest one or from the lower zone to the 1. zone. The scale interval can be the multiples of 1,2 and 5. For
example when e1=2, e2=2*e1=2*2=4 and calculated as 5 which is the next
scale interval.

ECI Multi Functional Weighing Indicator User Manual (Automatic) Sayfa 103 Rng: In this operation there are 3 different scale intervals and
capacities. There is a different scale interval in each capacity
range;
e1 (first zone scale interval): is determined with Resolution
parameter
e2 = 2*e1 (the second zone scale interval): is determined
automatically
e3 = 2*e2 (the third zone scale interval): is determined
automatically
If the respective zone capacity +9e is observed when the weight
is increased, it is proceeded to the next scale interval. However, the scale interval does not change when shifting from the 3. zone
to the 2. one or from the 2. zone to the 1. one when the weight is
decreasing. It is shifted to e1 when the weight is below 0,5 e(i).
The scale interval can be the multiples of 1,2 and 5. For example when e1=2, e2=2*e1=2*2=4 and calculated
as 5 which is the next scale interval. It is shifted to 3 partition operation mode when the measuring type is
selected as "Multi Interval" or "Multi P artition". In such case, following menus are displayed respectively in
order to determine the upper and lower Zone limits. In multi partition systems
Capacity>UpperZoneLimit>LowerZoneLimit must be entered.

E-MDL -EXP or E- MDL -BCD modules can be connected to Slot6. The connections are given below in detail.
10.4.1 E-MDL -BCD (Binary Output Module)
This is a BCD or Binary output (19 + 1 Bit) module.
The outputs are active when the pin no 11 (VCC_INN) and pin no 24 (OUT_EN) are short circuited. If the user
wants to receive data continuously, the pins 11,24 are short circuited. No data transfer occurs as long as the pin
no 11 is empty.
-0 (minus zero) value is sent from Binary and BCD outputs before the measurement and in cases of errors.

1) It is waited for the start entry or pressing start key.
2) Tare is taken upon start input and Start -up Delay period starts (if "Start -upDelay" period is entered).
3) Ready input is waited at the end of the Star Delay period
4) When ready input is activated, Fast output, slow output and next silo output are activated, too. Decision delay
period starts.
5) When the value filled at the end of the decision delay period reaches to the Target Value-(Chute Value +
Sensitive Amount), the fast output becomes passive and Decision delay period restarts.
6) When the value filled at the end of the decision delay period reaches to the target -shot value, slow output and silo
output also becomes passive. Decision delay period starts
7) When Stagnancy occurs at the end of the decision period (200 ms), Shot value is updated if Auto- Shot "On" is
selected. The quantity taken is transferred to the total. If the quantity taken is out of tolerance, the system goes idle
and error output is given (if the RecipeTolerance value is entered). For the next silo, if any, the operations after the
2.step are repeated.
8) If there is no silos, the discharge input is waited.
9) When the discharge input is detected, discharge delay period starts (1.5 sec*)
10) At the end of the discharge delay period, discharge output is activated.
11) When the (Weight value- Tare) < Zero Stripe, closing delay. (500ms*) starts. 11 Annex 2: Batching Program

Note: In “repetitve” mode, “ Pot Capacity” and “ Target Value” should be same.

ECI Multi Functional Weighing Indicator User Manual (Automatic) Sayfa 220 Pot Capacity
It is the maximum weight value determined for the batching.
If the total quantity intended to be batched is greater than
the "Scale Capacity", more than one filling is made by
dividing as multipliers of the Scale Capacity.
It is also used as the limit of the reservoir that is filled. Thus,
no filling with the quantity more than the value stated in this
parameter will be made to the scale.
Auto Chute
The weight value hang after the valve is closed is calculated automatically. When this parameter is selected
"On"

corrected automatically.
The options are;

BatchToleranc
It is the maximum error allowed per silo. If this value is exceeded, the device gives error and related relay output is
activated. It is valid for all silos in the recipe. In case of false
filling from any silo, the error output is activated. If no error

It is the maximum period that lapses during which the
weight value does not change at least 10*0 (Resolution)

ECI Multi Functional Weighing Indicator User Manual (Automatic) Sayfa 317 14.1 Working Principle of the System
Peak Hold program, keeps the value on the screen as the break point, in case the measurement value suddenly
decreases equal to or more than the value specified by the user.
If the hold feature is active, the break point is found as when the load value decreases equal to or greater than the "drop value". Normally, the tensioned
materials yield at some values before breaking, and the load is suddenly cut off at the moment of fracture. It is necessary to know the maximum yield value that may occur in order to correctly detect that the decreasing display
value of the indicator is caused by yielding in the material while the material
is not broken yet. In case of a decrease equal to or greater than the value
you have determined, the last screen value of the material before breaking
remains on the screen.
An overload value can be specified to protect the system. If the "Positive
Max" value is exceeded when it is in the positive weight value, the relay
output number 2 becomes active; if the "Negative Max" value is exceeded when it is in the negative weight value, the
relay output number 4 becomes active. 14 Annex 5: Peak Hold Program

Error 1 Maximum Load! This message is displayed when the measured value is more than
"Capacity" + 9e.
Error 3 Zero Limit! The load with this value cannot be zerod. It can be zeroed with zero
calibration.
Error 5 LoadCellError Load cell may be defected or there is a problem with the connection.
Error 6 ADC Data Error! ADC Module is defective. Consult ESIT.
Error 10 Coeff.OutofLimit It shows that the coefficient calculated as the result of the calibration is
out of limit. The load used must be increased or the value to be
calibrated must be decreased.
Error 11 Insufficient Load! It shows that the load used for the calibration is not sufficient. The load
used must be increased.
Error 12 2mV/V Only It can be used only for 2mV/V load cell.
Error 21 No record! No back -up has been made for the load cell. Thus it cannot be
